Hi,

my name is Andrea and I am a 26 years old cyber security specialist. I started my academic journey into cyber security field at the University of Padua where I studied Computer Engineering and graduated in bachelor and master degree with thesis related to network and satellite security, the latter working for an european project. Next I took my first steps in the security fields with a position focused specially on the network side, then I decide to move versus new fields looking closer the cyber security world getting in daily contact with vulnerabilities, exploits and malware. 

I love to break and understand how things works since I was a little boy, my first contact with the cyber security field happens when I have around 13 years old thanks to the curiosity related to understand how hacking programs works on PC videogames. I am very curious by nature and this is due to the satisfaction that I have when I learn new technical stuff and connect the pieces together.

Outside the security area I am enthusiast about basketball, I played for many years and also cover for around 10 years the role of referee managing to referee matches at national and international level.
